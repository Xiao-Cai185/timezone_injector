# Build Directory

This directory contains the compiled binaries generated by GitHub Actions.

## Files

After a successful build, you will find:

- **gui_injector.exe** - Main GUI application for timezone injection
- **timezonehook.dll** - Hook DLL that intercepts timezone API calls
- **injector.exe** - Legacy command-line injector tool

## Usage

1. Download both `gui_injector.exe` and `timezonehook.dll`
2. Place them in the same directory
3. Run `gui_injector.exe`

For detailed usage instructions, see [USAGE.md](../USAGE.md)

## Automated Builds

Binaries are automatically built and committed to this directory by GitHub Actions whenever code is pushed to the main/master branch.

The build workflow:
1. Compiles the C++ source files using MSVC
2. Generates optimized release binaries
3. Commits them back to this directory
4. Also uploads them as GitHub Actions artifacts

## Manual Build

If you want to build locally instead of using the pre-built binaries, see the build instructions in [README.md](../README.md).
